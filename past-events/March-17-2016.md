###Update!
The structure of our repo has changed. All problems now have their own folder inside our "challenges" repo.
Our hope is that this makes it considerably easier to browse past problems.
Unfortunately in the process we've lost a lot of our git history. We've gone back and tried to add back references, but if you notice that a past solution or problem you submitted has an incorrect or missing reference, please feel free to make a pull request to fix it!
