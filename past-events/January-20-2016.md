### Primer on Recommender engines and the algorithms that back them

Have you ever wondered how Netflix or Amazon knows what you want sometimes before you do ? In this talk we will explore what are the most common algorithms used in recommender engines and what are the main applications in our daily lives. You will also learn the difference between collaborative filtering and content-based similarity and how you could build the most simple recommender engine in your language of preference.

Presenter:

Stefania Druga, founder of HacKIDemia, an organization that designs robotics and maker workshops for kids all over the world, and recent Flatironschool Web Development graduate You may have already met her at some of her hardware workshops for Women Who Code or running around at other hackathons.
